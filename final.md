Final Project Submission

Largely the same, but I will grade your projects completely.

Final Submission Grading (14% total): Will be graded as follows:

Prototype (7%) Judged from your code, documentation and presentation.

System Architecture & Modelling: Clear object-oriented design.

Testing: Comprehensive tests - evidence of exploratory / scripted tests.

Version Control: Effective use of Git and issue tracking.

Code Quality: Correct, reliable, maintainable, and standards-compliant.

Security: Mitigated risks with secure coding and deployment.

Error Handling: Graceful failures with clear feedback.

Extensibility: Supports future enhancements and cross-platform deployment.

Usability (3%) Assessed based on both the quantity and quality of bugs, as well as the overall user experience (new).

Documentation (2%) Clarity, completeness, and succinctness of your README.md.

Presentation (2%) Quality of your 15-minute presentation, upload to Group Project Final Submission on Canvas.
